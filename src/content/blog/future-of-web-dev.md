The landscape of web development is shifting beneath our feet. As a developer with over 20 years of experience, I've seen trends come and go—from the rise of jQuery to the dominance of React. But the current wave of AI integration feels different.

## The AI Revolution

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword; it's a practical tool that is accelerating our workflows. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are not replacing developers but augmenting our capabilities.

### What This Means for Senior Devs

For senior developers, this shift requires a pivot in mindset. It's no longer just about writing syntax; it's about:

1.  **System Architecture**: Designing robust systems that can integrate AI services.
2.  **Prompt Engineering**: Learning to communicate effectively with LLMs.
3.  **Code Review**: shifting focus from syntax checking to logic and security verification.

## Conclusion

The future is bright for those who adapt. By embracing these new tools, we can build faster, better, and more ambitious projects than ever before.
